# Trusses
Python-based application to visualize and compute stresses in a 2D or 3D truss following standard statically-determinate (or overdetermined) trusses.   
Visualizer built off MeshVisualizer by tkrasnoperov. 3D visualization is sudo - only estimates depth.  
Please see main.py for an example construction of a truss and its output.   
Overstressed values are based on data at the top of main.py, which is provided for the balsa pieces listed for the exercise. These values can be changed or ignored.
